# Udacity-Score-Counter
This repository has been created to version control my score keeper applicaiton intended to be submitted. Project is for Udacity's "Android Basics Nanaodegree by Google" nanodegree program. This project is number 2/11.

# Project Overview (From Udacity)
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

The goal is to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice. To build this project, you can follow along with the practice set and customize the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport. 

# What will I Iearn? (From Udacity)
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Adding button code to your app
- Updating views
- Properly scoping variables
- Finding views by their ID

### Layout ###
CRITERIA | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
---------|-----------------------
Game Chosen | The chosen game has either multiple amounts of points that can be scored, as in american football, or multiple important metrics to track, such as fouls, outs, and innings in baseball. 
Overall layout | App is divided into two columns, one for each team.
Column contents | Each column contains a large TextView to keep track of the current score for that team. Optionally, a second TextView to track another important metric such as fouls can be added. 
Score buttons | Each column contains multiple buttons. The buttons must track either: <ul><li>Each track a different kind of scoring</li><li>Each track a different metric</li></ul>
Reset button | The layout contains a ‘reset’ button.
Best Practices | The code adheres to all of the following best practices: <ul><li>Text sizes are defined in sp</li><li>Lengths are defined in dp</li><li>Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.</li></ul>
